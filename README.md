# Purpose of this repository

I created this repository to track the development of my Tetris project.  
Additionally, I am trying to get acquainted with using Git and GitHub to improve my project management skills.

This repository will contain:
- A Tetris program written in the JACK programming language  
- A Tetris program written in C++ using the SDL2 library  
- An advanced Tetris version that integrates a user interface and a simple API  
- A Tetris version that incorporates AI (possibly using a Reinforcement Learning model)
- An offical Tetris project

I really hope to receive contributions from all of you.
