# Purpose of this repository

I created this repository to track the development of my Tetris project.  
Additionally, I am trying to get acquainted with using Git and GitHub to improve my project management skills.

This repository will contain:
- A Tetris program written in the JACK programming language  
- A Tetris program written in C++ using the SDL2 library  
- An advanced Tetris version that integrates a user interface and a simple API
- A Tetris version that incorporates AI (possibly using a Reinforcement Learning model)
- An offical Tetris project

# My Personal Goal for This Project
My goal in pursuing this project is to develop both my technical and soft skills through a hands-on, long-term software development journey. Specifically, I aim to:
- Practice professional workflows using Git and GitHub
- Learn how to design and build modular, scalable applications
- Strengthen my programming skills across multiple languages (JACK, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- Learn how to use some techniques for this project (gRPC, 	Flask, FastAPI, JSON)
- Apply artificial intelligence techniques to solve real problems (such as using reinforcement learning to create a self-playing Tetris AI)

I really hope to receive contributions from all of you.
